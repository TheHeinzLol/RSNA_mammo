# RSNA_mammo
Computer vision project for detecting cancer on breast CT scans.
For code and presentation proceed to: https://github.com/TheHeinzLol/RSNA_mammo/blob/main/RSNA_cancer_prediction.ipynb

Done:
  - Windowing.
  - Converting dcm to png.
  - Resizing to 1024x768 WxH.
  - Separate data into train and test splits.
  - Data augmentation.
  - Add multiprocessing.
  - Identify and delete corrupted data.
  - Create dataloaders for pytorch.
  - Write custom metrics formulae.
  - Write training and test loops for pytorch.
  - Use tensorboard to track performance.
  - Apply transfer learning or come up with own model architecture. Hardware is a limiting factor, so I am inclined towards transfer learning.
  - Deprecated: Load images to GoogleDrive to train in Colab.
  - Load data to Kaggle ant train models there.
  - Reduced data amount for Google Colab.
  - Wrote custom Dataset class.
  - Visualize most important steps.

Not ordered list of things to be done:
  - Training.
  - Inference.
